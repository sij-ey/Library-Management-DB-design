              ** Library Management System - Database**
     **Description**
This project provides a complete relational database design for a Library Management System using MySQL. It models key entities such as Books, Authors, Members, Loans, Categories, and Publishers. The schema supports typical library operations including tracking book details, multiple authors per book, membership information, and loan management with due and return dates.

The database enforces data integrity with primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and proper relationships (one-to-many and many-to-many). It is suitable for implementing backend database functionality for a library management application.

    ** How to Set Up / Run**
1. Ensure you have MySQL installed and running on your machine.
2. Open your MySQL client or workbench.
3. Import or run the SQL script `library_management.sql` by executing:
   ```sql
   SOURCE /path/to/library_management.sql;
